							<hr>
							<br>
							Captain Steven Grant "Steve" Rogers is a World War II veteran, a founding member of the Avengers, and Earth's first known superhero. 
							Rogers grew up suffering from numerous health problems, and upon America's entry into World War II, he was rejected from serving in 
							the United States Army despite several attempts to enlist. Rogers ultimately volunteered for Project Rebirth, where he was the only 
							recipient of the Super Soldier Serum developed by Abraham Erskine under the Strategic Scientific Reserve. The serum greatly enhanced 
							Rogers' physical abilities to superhuman levels. After Erskine's assassination and being doubted by SSR head director Chester Phillips, 
							Rogers was relegated to performing in war bond campaigns, where he posed as a patriotic mascot under the moniker of Captain America.
							<br><br>
							In 1943, Rogers rejoined the SSR after single-handedly liberating Allied prisoners from a HYDRA base, after which he began leading 
							his team of Howling Commandos in many operations against HYDRA. His World War II exploits made Rogers a living legend, and during this 
							time he also formed a close relationship with SSR agent Peggy Carter. Rogers ultimately helped the Allies win the war and defeat 
							HYDRA's leader Red Skull, but crashed into the Arctic during his final mission to stop a plane carrying bombs bound for the United States. 
							Rogers then spent sixty-six years unconscious and frozen in ice under a state of suspended animation, before he was eventually found by 
							S.H.I.E.L.D. in the early 21st century.
							<br><br>
							When he awoke, Rogers found himself alone in a modern world that he hardly recognized, with no idea what to do with his life. Following 
							Loki's theft of the Tesseract from S.H.I.E.L.D., Nick Fury enlisted Rogers' help in retrieving the Tesseract and stopping Loki from 
							destroying the world. Joining the Avengers, Rogers played a key role in the Battle of New York, successfully stopping the invasion, 
							capturing Loki, and reacquiring the Tesseract.
							<br><br>
							Rogers then joined S.H.I.E.L.D. as a counter-terrorist operative. While uncovering a conspiracy inside the organization, he encountered 
							the Winter Soldier, and discovered that HYDRA had infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. intending to use Project Insight as a way to bring about a 
							despotic new world order. He then learned that Winter Soldier was his best friend Bucky Barnes, who he thought was killed in action 
							during World War II, but had since been physically enhanced and brainwashed by HYDRA. Alongside Black Widow, Maria Hill and Falcon, 
							Rogers then ended the HYDRA Uprising at the Battle at the Triskelion.

							Rogers and the Avengers reassembled and embarked in an all-out war against HYDRA, recapturing the Scepter and capturing Baron Strucker. 
							After Ultron, the new peacekeeping artificial intelligence program designed by Tony Stark and Bruce Banner, had went rogue, Rogers and 
							the Avengers rallied to stop it from exterminating humanity. Ultron was ultimately defeated during the Battle of Sokovia, after which 
							several of the original Avengers departed, leaving Rogers and Romanoff to lead and train the new Avengers team.
							<br><br>
							The new Avengers conducted several international missions, but failed to avert a catastrophic incident while on assignment to capture 
							Crossbones in Nigeria. The United Nations used the disaster to ratify the Sokovia Accords, but Rogers saw their draconian nature and 
							refused to sign, resulting in a rift between himself and Avengers co-leader Tony Stark. After the Accords ratification was bombed, with 
							Bucky Barnes resurfacing as the primary suspect, Rogers and his anti-accord allies became fugitives of the law while assisting in his escape. 
							Upon learning Helmut Zemo was the true mastermind, Rogers fought against Stark and his pro-accord allies before confronting Zemo in Siberia. 
							When Zemo revealed Barnes' role in the Assassination of Howard and Maria Stark, Rogers came to Barnes' defense once an enraged Stark attacked 
							him. They engaged in a fierce fight with Stark and emerged the victor, but with the Avengers deeply divided. Rogers eventually rescued some of 
							his anti-accord associates from the Raft, and had Barnes sent to Wakanda to be cured of his brainwashing.
							<br><br>
							Rogers, Black Widow, Falcon, and Scarlet Witch continued to be fugitives from the law, but when Thanos and his Black Order attacked Earth 
							seeking the final Infinity Stones, Rogers emerged from hiding in order to protect Vision. Rogers had Vision brought to Wakanda, and came to 
							the country's defense when it was attacked by the Order an onslaught of Outriders. Captain America failed to stop Thanos from taking the Mind 
							Stone and initiating the Snap, wherein half the universe's population was wiped. Rogers survived, and journeyed through space to Planet 0259-S, 
							where the Avengers killed Thanos.
							<br><br>
							Five years after the Snap, Rogers and his fellow Avengers eventually found a way to safely travel through time, returning to various points in 
							the past to amass all six Infinity Stones, making amends with Tony Stark in the process. The stones were used to initiate the Blip, and he 
							resumed the mantle of Captain America once more to participate in the Battle of Earth, where he discovered he was deemed worthy of Mjølnir, 
							wielding it in combat against Thanos and his army from an alternate timeline. After Stark sacrificed his life to wipe out Thanos and his armies, 
							Rogers volunteered to return the stones to their respective timelines. He opted to return and remain in the 1940s, where he married Peggy Carter. 
							Rogers grew old and reunited with his friends in the present, entrusting Sam Wilson with his mantle and shield. Rogers entered retirement, with 
							his current whereabouts unknown to the general public.

						<br>
						<hr>
						<br>
						Considered by many as the world's first and greatest superhero, Steve Rogers has been defined by his courage, patriotism, and righteousness. Rogers has always 
						had a noble and honest spirit, intolerant towards injustice and abuses of power. Since he grew up weak and small, he learned on his own that true strength is 
						having the courage to fight against abuse, no matter one's power, and having compassion for the innocent. Despite being transformed into a perfect human by the 
						Super Soldier Serum, he maintained his original values and character. Since his reawakening, Rogers was saddened by losing so much of his time, but still 
						retains the same values he had since the 1940s. Due to his famed past exploits and his continued works to save the world, Rogers is generally respected by many; 
						even if he doesn't seek acknowledgment for his deeds. He was also very empathetic; being able to understand and relate to both Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver 
						before meeting them and understanding Tony Stark's motivation during the Avengers Civil War, despite Iron Man being on the opposing side. He also conceded that 
						Stark had very good reasons not to join the Time Heist and openly said he was happy that his friend had finally found the peace that he'd so desperately wanted.
						<br><br>
						What separates Steve Rogers from the other Avengers is two things: his humanity and morality. Steve Rogers is an extremely dedicated person. Despite originally 
						being physically weak and small, and rejected many times due to his frail health, he still tried to enlist in the Army during World War II. Steve tried to be of 
						service to his country in whatever way he was allowed; even when his talents were wasted when he was ordered to inspire the American soldiers and support the war 
						effort by starring in propaganda. When he heard that the 107th battalion, including Barnes, was captured in a nearby HYDRA facility, Rogers disobeyed his superior's 
						orders and went behind enemy lines in an apparent suicide mission and rescued them. Rogers finds the courage to defend the weak and innocent, and does not hesitate 
						to stand up to corrupt politicians, hypocritical authority figures, powerful beings like Loki, or even the nearly omnipotent Thanos. His determination also aids him, 
						giving him a boost in physical power to allow him to hold off beings of much greater strength, with this even allowing him to survive against Thanos. A true hero, 
						Rogers is more than willing to sacrifice himself to protect others and does not care if he is considered the villain in his heroic job, as his desire to protect 
						the innocent remained as strong as ever, even after he was deemed a criminal. Though he refused to give up in the immediate aftermath of the Snap, following the 
						disastrous Ambush on Thanos, even Rogers conceded defeat. When Scott Lang returned however, Rogers quickly got his fighting spirit back, being the first to support 
						Scott's plan. The true extent of his determination and selfless heroism was fully exemplified when he finally proved himself worthy to wield Mjølnir. Amusingly 
						however, when facing off with his past self, Rogers actually seemed annoyed by his own sheer determination.
						<br><br>
						Rogers is not afraid to do what's right for the greater good and make the tough choices, even if it might be costly to him personally. As both a soldier and an Avenger, 
						Rogers knows full well that war has its casualties and some of his dearest friends, or even himself, may need to make the ultimate sacrifice. He was willing to justify 
						violence and killing to defend others and to preserve peace and freedom, even when Nick Fury called him out on various war crimes he and the American army committed 
						during World War II. Rogers once had to tell Natasha Romanoff to close the Chitauri portal, despite Stark not being out yet. Rogers was also willing to fight his best 
						friend Bucky Barnes when the latter was preventing Steve from saving millions of lives. Nevertheless, Captain America will always prioritize the safety of innocents. 
						For example, Rogers would not abandon Novi Grad until all of its citizens were evacuated; even when Ultron was planning on smashing the city to the ground to destroy 
						the Earth. His heroism and determination to what he believes is morally right, no matter the personal cost, even allowed him to move Mjølnir slightly when he attempted 
						to lift it following the retrieval of the Scepter, much to the surprise and discomfort of Thor. He also does not approve of sacrificing others to achieve victory 
						should other options remain available; he refused to let Vision sacrifice himself, instead looking for a way to separate him from the Mind Stone.
						<br><br>
						Captain America's uncompromising sense of morality and selflessness often puts him at odds with Tony Stark, who is more comfortable with a grey morality to protect people. 
						This has led to several moments of bickering, arguments, and almost physical fights over the direction of the Avengers in how to protect people. This difference in 
						attitude, reached a head in the Avengers Civil War, where Tony sought to compromise with governments who were increasingly intolerant with collateral damage, while 
						Rogers refused to do so, believing it would inhibit the Avengers' response time, eventually causing him to become a fugitive. Rogers nevertheless still cared for Tony 
						and did not desire for them to fight, as he pleaded with Tony to stop attacking Bucky, as the latter did it without having control and did not kill him after beating him, 
						even going as far as to send him a letter to apologize and a phone so Stark can contact him. He was visibly ashamed when Tony demanded him to tell the truth of his parents' 
						death, and felt enough sympathy and remorse for keeping the truth hidden that he relinquished his shield and returned it to the Stark family. Two years later, after much 
						of the anger between the two factions of Avengers had died down, Rogers outright referred to Iron Man as Earth's "best defender," even joking that he himself was a poor 
						substitute emphasizing the respect he maintained for Tony.
						<br><br>
						While Captain America's sense of duty exceeds his personal feelings, his sense of loyalty is difficult to surpass. After realizing the Winter Soldier was his long thought 
						to be a dead best friend, he only fought him to disable HYDRA's Helicarriers. However, once the Helicarriers were destroyed, he immediately stopped fighting the Winter 
						Soldier in an attempt to reason with him and help him remember their friendship. This reached its apex in the Avengers Civil War, where Steve steadfastly refused to give 
						up on Bucky, which caused the Avengers to fracture along with more than half their number to become fugitives.
						<br><br>
						Since being defrosted by S.H.I.E.L.D., Steve was lost in a world he no longer knew. America had changed; though technology had greatly advanced, humane morals were constantly 
						being compromised in favor of political expediency. To make matters worse, most of the people he loved from his past were gone, or greatly aged. Even while working with 
						S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers, Steve still had no real life outside of being a soldier. Steve did not know how to belong and strives to uphold his code of honor in this new 
						complicated world. Although he eventually reunited with both Peggy and Bucky, Steve was still a "man out of time." However, after the battle against Ultron, Steve finally 
						realized that he was no longer the man he was before he was frozen. Hence, Steve decided to focus his life on just helping people, taking a permanent role as the leader of 
						the second incarnation of the Avengers.
						<br><br>
						He is very protective of his friends from his past, especially Bucky Barnes, and is willing to go to great lengths to save them, being susceptible to emotional and violent 
						acts to fulfill his goal. He seems to have developed a trust and attraction towards Sharon Carter. During his time with the new team of Avengers, he developed a trust and 
						bond with Black Widow. He also embraces links to his own time, often seeing much of Howard Stark in Tony. He is also very selfless and is willing to risk his life for his 
						teammates, such as when he jumped in to save Black Widow from Proxima Midnight, without knowing he would be strong enough to hold back her spear.
						<br><br>
						He does have a darker side, however, with Ultron noting that Rogers had been a soldier for so long, he subconsciously craved conflict and battles to avoid a civilian life and 
						being forced to confront all he lost. Indeed, his worst nightmare, caused by Scarlet Witch. Maximoff, was shown to be the end of the war, with people not needing him anymore, 
						leaving him with one hollow realization: everyone whom he had ever loved was gone, and he was alone. Overall, Rogers is a selfless person but one with a notable blind spot: 
						his childhood friend Bucky Barnes. The last living link to his time, Rogers was willing to do everything to protect him, going so far as to abandon his role as leader of the 
						Avengers and a team player. When Tony called Rogers out on failing the role of Captain America, at the end of their fight during the Avengers Civil War, Rogers abandoned his 
						shield and with it, the identity of "Captain America," heeding Tony's point. Even years later, he had made no efforts to reclaim the moniker allowing his uniform to darken and 
						removing the American stars that had once adorned it.
						<br><br>
						Rogers has a strong dislike for agencies or groups that express control over the individual, due to having fought vigorously for his nations' freedom and losing the world he knew 
						for that very reason. This dislike extends to groups of any ideology be they HYDRA, S.H.I.E.L.D., or even America's own government. Rogers himself admits that the Howling 
						Commandos committed less than moral actions during World War II, but it was for the basis that people could be free, whereas Project Insight was using fear to dissuade a national 
						security risk before it happens, eliminating the need for a soldier like himself and taking away the American people's freedom. The desire for free will heavily influenced Rogers' 
						opinion on the Sokovia Accords. He strongly believed that the extravagant politics involved would restrict (or at least hinder) the Avengers' efforts to protect innocent people, 
						putting him at odds with the very pragmatic Tony Stark on the issue. His opinion on such groups lessened, when the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre locked up Barnes in a cage. 
						In the end, such was his dislike that he cut all ties with them and became a fugitive after the Avengers Civil War. While he still retains his desire to protect the innocent, 
						he has no desire to be re-acknowledged as a superhero and does not care about the opinions of government bodies, as he coldly told Thaddeus Ross that he did not care if the latter 
						disapproves of him and even went as far as to say he would not hesitate to fight him if he got in his way.
						<br><br>
						The Snap had a profound effect on Rogers' optimism, with their failure to stop Thanos causing him to take on a darker, yet somewhat grim persona, even non-verbally conceding that 
						Tony's intentions behind Ultron's creation had been noble and would aid in Infinity War, if the AI had not gone rogue. When Thanos was revealed to had destroyed the Infinity Stones, 
						Rogers stopped his fight for the next five years, instead choosing to become a grief counselor, before Scott Lang returned with a plan. After Tony had sacrificed himself to win the 
						Battle of Earth, Rogers honored his friend by finally retiring and enjoying the life he'd never thought he'd have.

							<h3 id="powers">Powers & Abilities</h3>
							<br>
							<hr>
							<br>
							<span>Artificially Enhanced Physiology</span>: The Super Soldier Serum enhanced all of Rogers' bodily functions, such as his strength, durability, speed, agility, stamina, reflexes, senses, 
							healing, and lifespan to enhanced levels. He is very muscular, athletic and physically capable. The Super Soldier Serum also healed all of his ailments, physical and genetic 
							imperfections instantly, giving him a perfect body better than that of a man in his physical prime. It also prevents him from getting intoxicated by alcohol, meaning he cannot 
							get drunk. The Super Soldier Serum permanently transformed him from a frail young man into the "perfect" specimen of human development and conditioning.
							<br><br>
							<span>Mjølnir Capabilities</span>: Rogers is worthy to hold Mjølnir. He nearly lifted the hammer at an Avengers afterparty, but stopped before he could in order to spare Thor's feelings, 
							and finally lifted the hammer to stand up to Thanos during the Battle of Earth. Due to the enchantments placed on the mystic hammer, Rogers was given the ability to focus on 
							Thor's abilities and take advantage of them to considerably increase his abilities. The hammer also allowed him to easily take advantage of the weather elements.
							<br><br>
							<span>Master Martial Artist</span>: Rogers is an extremely skilled and formidable hand-to-hand combatant and martial artist, having extensive levels of knowledge of melee combat as well as being 
							considerably experienced in combat operations, making him one of the most powerful and best fighters on the planet. He has mastered numerous martial arts such as muay Thai, boxing, Krav Maga, 
							Taekwondo, savate, wushu, judo, and Brazilian jiu-jitsu, kickboxing, wrestling, aikido, karate, and wing chun. Even in World War II, when he was still inexperienced, Captain America has already 
							proven to be a skilled fighter, having used his knowledge of combat, his enhanced attributes, and shield to defeat hundreds of Nazi soldiers with ease and even Red Skull himself. After being 
							defrosted in the 21st century, Rogers was quickly put into action again and remained as skilled as ever; he was able to stand against Loki in combat, holding him long enough for Iron Man to aid 
							in arresting him, hold his own against an enraged Thor during their first encounter to standstill with aid of his shield, and also managed to defeat hordes of Chitauri aliens at the Battle of New York.
							<br><br>
							<span>Shield Mastery</span>: Rogers is extremely skilled at using his unique shield in combat, with years of training and experience in wielding it, as well as completely mastered its physical properties, 
							allowing him to accomplish amazing feats with the item.
							<br><br>
							<span>Expert Marksman</span>: Rogers is an skilled marksman, being able to throw projectile weaponry with extreme accuracy and is well-versed in the use of firearms like the military-issued Colt 1911 
							or the Thompson submachine gun during World War II and eventually modern firearms, picking up a Noveske N4 Diplomat and using it with ease.
							<br><br>
							<span>Master Acrobat</span>: Rogers' years of training and experience have made him an extremely skilled acrobat, gymnast, and aerialist, being able to fluidly dodge attacks from multiple directions 
							using coordinated flips, twists, and sharp turns without losing balance. He often utilizes these talents in combat for both evasive and offensive purposes. Combined with his enhanced agility, 
							Rogers has expertise in utilizing parkour and tricking flips in his attacks and takedowns.
							<br><br>
							<span>Expert Spy</span>: Aside from being a veteran soldier as well as one of the world's greatest combatants and martial artists, Rogers is highly skilled in espionage, intelligence gathering, stealth, infiltration, and sabotage.
							<br><br>
							<span>Master Tactician</span>: Rogers is an excellent strategist and tactical genius. He can formulate battle strategies and his brilliant tactical sense allows him to alter near any strategy to fit the changing needs of the situation.

								<li>Rogers is 6'2" and weighs 240 lbs.</li>
								</br>
								<li>According to Guidebook to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Captain America/Steve Rogers is based on the comics version of his 616 mainstream counterpart. While the Marvel Cinematic Universe version of Captain America's date of birth 
								is listed as July 4, 1918, the mainstream comics version's date of birth is July 4, 1922.</li>
								</br>
								<li>According to Anthony and Joe Russo, Steve Rogers' travel to the 1940s at the end of Avengers: Endgame created an alternate timeline, where he lived out a life with Peggy Carter, eventually traveling back to the prime timeline 
								in his old age. However, screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely gave a contradictory explanation, stating that Captain America did not create an alternate timeline, but rather traveled to the past of the same timeline, 
								meaning that his life with Peggy Carter meant he had always been her husband in the original timeline, as well as the father of her two children.</li>
								</br>
								<li>In the comics, Rogers originally drinks the Super Soldier formula, while in the movie Rogers is transformed into Captain America through injections and radiation, designed by Abraham Erskine and Howard Stark.</li>
								</br>
								<li>Although it isn't shown, during the events of Avengers: Endgame, Rogers traveled to Asgard in order to return the Reality Stone and Mjølnir. That makes him the third known human after Jane Foster and Bruce Banner to visit Asgard.</li>
								</br>
								<li>Trevor Slattery has a tattoo of Captain America's shield on his neck, but instead of a star in the middle of the circles, is the symbol for anarchy.</li>
								</br>
								<li>Method Man mentioned Captain America in his song "Bulletproof Love" in the Luke Cage episode Soliloquy of Chaos.</li>
								</br>
								<li>The helmet he wears on his first mission is a homage to the Ultimate Universe WWII Captain America's helmet.</li>
								</br>
								<li>His triangular shield is based on the character's original shield, as well as the Ultimate version.</li>
								</br>
								<li>In the comics, Rogers has been shown to be worthy of wielding Mjølnir on four separate occasions, such as Thor #390, Fear Itself #7, Secret Empire #10, and Avengers Volume 8 #28. Rogers' Earth-93074 counterpart is also worthy, as well as his daughter from Earth-9811.</li>
								</br>
								<li>In Avengers: Endgame, when Rogers attempts to get the Scepter from Jasper Sitwell, he says "hail HYDRA," similar to what Steve Rogers said in the Secret Empire series in the comics, when it's revealed that Captain America was a sleeper agent for HYDRA.</li>
